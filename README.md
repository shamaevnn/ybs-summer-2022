# [Mega Market Backend](https://ybs.shamaevn.com/docs)
### Made by [@shamaevnn](https://t.me/shamaevnn)
Solving practical part of task. Avaiable at https://ybs.shamaevn.com/docs#


Implemented methods:
* `GET` nodes with children. It's made with **ONLY ONE** SQL request. Tests are passed âœ…
* `DELETE` item with all corresponding items, tests âœ…
* `POST` import item, update if exists, tests âœ…
* `GET` item sale **statistics**, tests âœ…

All of them are available [here](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/tree/master/app/api), in `routes.py` particularly.

## Used Technologies
* Python with `FastAPI` for backend
* Database: `PostgreSQL`. Just have a look at this [AMAZING QUERY](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/blob/master/app/models/items/queries.py#L14) ðŸ‘€ via
postgres to get item and all it's children recursively.
* Data validation: `Pydantic`
* Linters: `mypy`, `flake8`, `black`
* `GitHub Actions` for deployment

## Database
This solution uses only 2 tables: [items](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/blob/master/app/models/items/table_schema.py) for 3 main endpoints
and [items_statistic](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/blob/master/app/models/items_statistic/table_schema.py) for statistic endpoint


## First run
1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022.git
cd ybs-summer-2022
```
2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```
3. Install `pre-commit` hooks
```
pre-commit install-hooks
pre-commit install
```
4. Create `.env` file, don't forget to set proper variables
```
cp .env_example .env
```

## Running locally
1. Run all necessary services
```bash
make services
```
2. Apply migrations
```
make migrate
```
3.Run backend on FastAPI
```
make dev
```
4.Check http://0.0.0.0:80/docs, everything should be OK!


## Tests
```
make run_tests
```

## Linter
```
make lint
```


## Deployment info
Deploy to production via `GitHub Actions` consists of 3 steps:
1. Check all linters via pre-commit, it runs on any branch/pull request.

If it's success, then:
2. Login to github registry, build and push docker image.
3. Go to server via ssh and VPN, pull built docker image, stop old ones, start new one.

To deploy, you have to set several secret variables:
1. `VPN variables`.You can get it from your `.ovpn` file. Check [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/connect-vpn#how-to-prepare-file-ovpn) for more info.
```
CA_CRT  # encode to base64 content of <ca>
USER_CRT  # ... of <cert>
USER_KEY  # ... of <key>
VPN_FILE  #  check instruction above
```
2. `DATABASE_URL`, where your info about items will be stored, example:
```
postgresql://postgres:b9a59b43439d3ebac8a410c9@86.208.71.101:15336/ybs
```
3. `SERVER_IP` -- address of your server with backend.
4. `TOKEN_GITHUB` -- token with access to write/read/delete packages, check [this instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
5. `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` -- private key, which has access to server.
