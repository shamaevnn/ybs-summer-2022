# [Mega Market Backend](https://ybs.shamaevn.com/docs)
### Made by [@shamaevnn](https://t.me/shamaevnn)
Solving practical part of task. Avaiable at https://ybs.shamaevn.com/docs#


Implemented methods:
* `GET` nodes with children. It's made with **ONLY ONE** SQL request. Tests are passed âœ…
* `DELETE` item with all corresponding items, tests âœ…
* `POST` import item, update if exists, tests âœ…
* `GET` item sale **statistics**, tests âœ…

All of them are available [here](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/tree/master/app/api), in `routes.py` particularly.

## Used Technologies
* Python with `FastAPI` for backend
* Database: `PostgreSQL`. Just have a look at this [AMAZING QUERY](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/blob/master/app/models/items/queries.py#L14) ðŸ‘€ via
postgres to get item and all it's children recursively.
* Data validation: `Pydantic`
* Linters: `mypy`, `flake8`, `black`
* `GitHub Actions` for deployment

## Database
This solution uses only 2 tables: [items](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/blob/master/app/models/items/table_schema.py) for 3 main endpoints
and [items_statistic](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/blob/master/app/models/items_statistic/table_schema.py) for statistic endpoint


## First run
1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone git@github.com:shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022.git
cd ybs-summer-2022
```
2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```
3. Install `pre-commit` hooks
```
pre-commit install-hooks
pre-commit install
```
4. Create `.env` file, don't forget to set proper variables
```
cp .env_example .env
```

## Running locally
1. Run all necessary services
```bash
make services
```
2. Apply migrations
```
make migrate
```
3.Run backend on FastAPI
```
make dev
```
4.Check http://0.0.0.0/docs, everything should be OK!


## Tests
```
python3 tests/test_default.py
```

## Linter
```
make lint
```


## Deployment info
This app is deployed via [dokku](https://dokku.com/) -- free open-source version of Heroku.
Unfortunately, I haven't managed to deploy it to Yandex servers. Probably, because of VPN.

* Push or pull request to any branch triggers `checks.yml` github action with linters
* Push to `master` begins deployment process
