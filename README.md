## Used Technologies
* Python with `FastAPI` for backend
* Database: `PostgreSQL`. Just have a look at this [AMAZING QUERY](https://github.com/shamaevnn/ybs-summer-2022/blob/master/app/models/items/queries.py#L14) ðŸ‘€ via
postgres to get item and all it's children recursively.
* Data validation: `Pydantic`
* Linters: `mypy`, `flake8`, `black`
* `GitHub Actions` for deployment

```
2. Apply migrations
```
make migrate
```
3.Run backend on FastAPI
```

## Deployment info
This app is deployed via [dokku](https://dokku.com/) -- free open-source version of Heroku.
Unfortunately, I haven't managed to deploy it to Yandex servers. Probably, because of VPN.

* Push or pull request to any branch triggers `checks.yml` github action with linters
* Push to `master` begins deployment process
